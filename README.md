1. Business Understanding Phase:
Identify the requirements and constraints of the used car dealership.
The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a used car based on its characteristics, such as 'year', 'manufacturer', 'model', 'condition', 'cylinders', 'fuel', 'odometer', 'transmission', 'drive', 'size', 'type', 'paint_color', and 'state'.


2. Data Understanding Phase:
Gather and explore the dataset containing information on used cars.
Assess the quality of the data and identify any issues or anomalies.
Gain insights into the variables and their relationships with car prices.

3. Data Preparation Phase:
In the data preparation phase, the dataset is cleaned, transformed, and formatted to create the final dataset suitable for analysis. This includes tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and Cleaning the data by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

4. Modeling Phase:
The modeling phase focuses on selecting appropriate regression algorithms and building predictive models to estimate car prices based on various features such as year, manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel type, odometer reading, etc.

5. Evaluation Phase:
Validate the models' effectiveness in predicting car prices and identify any limitations or areas for improvement.
During the evaluation phase, the performance of the trained regression models is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The goal is to identify the model(s) that provide the most accurate predictions of car prices.

6. Deployment Phase:
Deploy the selected models for use in the used car dealership's pricing strategy.
Communicate the findings and recommendations to stakeholders, ensuring clear understanding and buy-in.
By following the CRISP-DM methodology, we can systematically uncover insights into the key drivers of used car prices and provide actionable recommendations to the client based on data-driven analysis.
Once a satisfactory model is selected, it can be deployed for practical use by the used car dealership. This may involve integrating the model into their existing systems or providing tools for the dealership staff to use the model to estimate car prices for customers.

Pairplot of Numerical Variables:

The pair plot provides a visual representation of the relationships between pairs of numerical variables, including 'id', 'price', 'year', and 'odometer'. From the pair plot, we can observe:
There doesn't seem to be a clear linear relationship between 'id' and other numerical variables.
There appears to be a positive correlation between 'price' and 'year', indicating that newer vehicles tend to have higher prices.
There is a negative correlation between 'price' and 'odometer', suggesting that vehicles with lower mileage tend to have higher prices.
'year' and 'odometer' don't seem to have a strong linear relationship based on the scatter plots.

Histogram of price:

The histogram of 'price' shows the distribution of vehicle prices in the dataset. It appears that the majority of vehicles have prices clustered around the lower end of the price range, with a few outliers at higher prices. This distribution might suggest that most vehicles in the dataset are relatively affordable, with a few luxury or high-value vehicles.

Histogram of year:

The histogram of 'year' indicates the distribution of vehicle model years. It shows that there are more recent vehicles in the dataset, with a peak around the years 2015-2020. This distribution suggests that the dataset contains a significant number of newer vehicles compared to older ones

Histogram of odometer:

The 'odometer' histogram displays the distribution of vehicle mileage. It indicates that many vehicles in the dataset have low mileage, with a peak at the lower end of the odometer range. This distribution suggests that the dataset contains a mix of both low-mileage and high-mileage vehicles, with more vehicles having lower mileage.





The plot shows individual data points for each car, where each point represents a combination of odometer reading and price.
The distribution of data points suggests the spread of prices across different odometer readings, indicating the variability in car prices based on mileage.
Trend:

From the plot, we can observe whether there is any discernible pattern or trend between odometer reading and price. For example, we might expect older cars with higher mileage to be priced lower compared to newer cars with lower mileage.


The histogram of vehicle age shows the distribution of ages of vehicles in the dataset. From the plot, we can observe the following:

Most of the vehicles in the dataset are relatively young, with ages ranging from 0 to around 20 years.
There are fewer vehicles with ages between 20 and 40 years.
Only a small number of vehicles have ages greater than 40 years.
This distribution provides insights into the age distribution of vehicles in the dataset, which can be valuable for understanding the composition of the vehicle population and for further analysis or modeling tasks.

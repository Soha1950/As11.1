the correlation coefficient between 'price' and 'year' is approximately 0, indicating a very weak correlation between the price of a car and the year it was manufactured.
Similarly, the correlation coefficient between 'price' and 'odometer' is approximately -0.16, indicating a weak negative correlation between the price of a car and its mileage (odometer reading). This suggests that as the odometer reading increases (indicating higher mileage), the price of the car tends to decrease slightly.

Odometer Reading (Mileage):

The x-axis represents the odometer reading of the cars, which indicates their mileage.
The odometer reading is scaled from 0 to approximately 1e7 (10 million), covering a wide range of mileage values.
Price of Cars:

The y-axis represents the prices of the cars.
The prices of cars are scaled from 0 to approximately 3.5, indicating the range of prices in the dataset.
Distribution of Data:

Pairplot of Numerical Variables:

The pair plot provides a visual representation of the relationships between pairs of numerical variables, including 'id', 'price', 'year', and 'odometer'. From the pair plot, we can observe:
There doesn't seem to be a clear linear relationship between 'id' and other numerical variables.
There appears to be a positive correlation between 'price' and 'year', indicating that newer vehicles tend to have higher prices.
There is a negative correlation between 'price' and 'odometer', suggesting that vehicles with lower mileage tend to have higher prices.
'year' and 'odometer' don't seem to have a strong linear relationship based on the scatter plots.

Histogram of price:

The histogram of 'price' shows the distribution of vehicle prices in the dataset. It appears that the majority of vehicles have prices clustered around the lower end of the price range, with a few outliers at higher prices. This distribution might suggest that most vehicles in the dataset are relatively affordable, with a few luxury or high-value vehicles.

Histogram of year:

The histogram of 'year' indicates the distribution of vehicle model years. It shows that there are more recent vehicles in the dataset, with a peak around the years 2015-2020. This distribution suggests that the dataset contains a significant number of newer vehicles compared to older ones

Histogram of odometer:

The 'odometer' histogram displays the distribution of vehicle mileage. It indicates that many vehicles in the dataset have low mileage, with a peak at the lower end of the odometer range. This distribution suggests that the dataset contains a mix of both low-mileage and high-mileage vehicles, with more vehicles having lower mileage.





The plot shows individual data points for each car, where each point represents a combination of odometer reading and price.
The distribution of data points suggests the spread of prices across different odometer readings, indicating the variability in car prices based on mileage.
Trend:

From the plot, we can observe whether there is any discernible pattern or trend between odometer reading and price. For example, we might expect older cars with higher mileage to be priced lower compared to newer cars with lower mileage.

 the correlation coefficient between 'price' and 'year' is approximately 0, indicating a very weak correlation between the price of a car and the year it was manufactured.
Similarly, the correlation coefficient between 'price' and 'odometer' is approximately -0.16, indicating a weak negative correlation between the price of a car and its mileage (odometer reading). This suggests that as the odometer reading increases (indicating higher mileage), the price of the car tends to decrease slightly.

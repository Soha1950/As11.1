the correlation coefficient between 'price' and 'year' is approximately 0, indicating a very weak correlation between the price of a car and the year it was manufactured.
Similarly, the correlation coefficient between 'price' and 'odometer' is approximately -0.16, indicating a weak negative correlation between the price of a car and its mileage (odometer reading). This suggests that as the odometer reading increases (indicating higher mileage), the price of the car tends to decrease slightly.

Odometer Reading (Mileage):

The x-axis represents the odometer reading of the cars, which indicates their mileage.
The odometer reading is scaled from 0 to approximately 1e7 (10 million), covering a wide range of mileage values.
Price of Cars:

The y-axis represents the prices of the cars.
The prices of cars are scaled from 0 to approximately 3.5, indicating the range of prices in the dataset.
Distribution of Data:

The plot shows individual data points for each car, where each point represents a combination of odometer reading and price.
The distribution of data points suggests the spread of prices across different odometer readings, indicating the variability in car prices based on mileage.
Trend:

From the plot, we can observe whether there is any discernible pattern or trend between odometer reading and price. For example, we might expect older cars with higher mileage to be priced lower compared to newer cars with lower mileage.
